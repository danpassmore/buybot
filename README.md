# buybot

Pre-Install Steps:

1) Make sure you have nodejs (npm) installed on your machine

Install instructions:

1) git clone https://github.com/danpassmore/buybot.git
2) `npm install`
3) `npm run start-dev`
4) This will fire both commands in the `Procfile` simultaneously
5) Your application will be at `localhost:3000` and your api will be at `localhost:3001/api/candles`.

`npm run start` will start the app only.
`npm run server` will start the server only.
These may be easier to use when debugging.
